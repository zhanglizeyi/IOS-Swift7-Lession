Autocomplete GUI files:
	
	Autocomplete.pro
	main.cpp
	mainwindow.h/cpp/ui
	mylineedit.h/cpp
	wordlist.h/cpp

Code for the project can be found on GitHub:
	https://github.com/cwscx/autoCompleter_GUI


How to run the GUI:
1) Use qmake to generate a Makefile by typing in the command below. Note: the Makefile in the working directory will be overwritten. If you have a Makefile to be used later in the current directory that is not for the GUI (aka not generated by the qmake), make sure to save it as something else or move it to another directory.

> qmake Autocomplete.pro

Or, if that does not work:

> /software/common64/qt-5.5.0/bin/qmake Autocomplete.pro

2) Compile as usual by running make

	> make

3) Run the GUI executable

> ./Autocomplete&

Note: It takes time to load the dictionary (roughly 1 minute), so please be patient if the GUI doesnâ€™t pop up at once. It also takes awhile to exit (roughly 30 seconds). You may want to use the ampersand ("&") above to prevent your terminal from hanging up on you.



For windows, assuming you are working a Qt with MinGW, run
    > mingw32-make
instead of make.

On my Windows system I had to move a couple .dll-s from Qt's bin
folder to the one where the binary resides. Not sure if we need
this step for Linux/Mac.
