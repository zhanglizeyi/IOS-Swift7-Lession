NOTE: You are free to use this starter code/Makefile as a basis for your
assignment, but using it is not a requirement. Feel free to throw out the
starter code and start from scratch. This starter code is provided as a
convenience, but you have complete freedom to design your implementation
in any way you see fit. However, be sure that whatever implementation
you use demonstrates good object-oriented design & coding style.
